The Virtual Try-On application is an innovative solution that allows users to experience a digital 
fashion fitting in real-time. By leveraging MediaPipe Pose for body landmark detection and 
OpenCV for image processing, the application superimposes clothing images, such as shirts or 
dresses, onto a live webcam feed based on the user's body pose. This application provides an 
immersive experience for virtual garment fitting, allowing users to visualize how different clothes 
would fit on their own body without the need for physical trial. 
The core of the application is built around the powerful MediaPipe Pose model, which detects 
key body landmarks such as the shoulders, hips, and wrists. Using these landmarks, the system 
calculates the size and placement of the clothing image, resizing and transforming it to match the 
user's body dimensions. The result is an accurate, interactive virtual try-on experience that 
enhances online shopping, fashion design, and virtual fitting rooms. 


Objective and Key Features 
Objective: 
The primary goal of the Virtual Try-On application is to provide users with a seamless, real-time 
experience of visualizing how garments will fit on their bodies. The system enables users to see 
a realistic overlay of clothing items, adjusted for their body size and shape, using just a webcam. 
Key Features: 
1. Real-Time Body Landmark Detection: 
The application uses MediaPipe Pose to detect and track the user's body landmarks in real
time, ensuring that the garment is correctly aligned with the user's pose. 

2. Clothing Overlay and Resizing: 
The garment image is resized dynamically based on the user's body proportions. The 
application ensures that the clothing fits appropriately over the user's body, adjusting both 
width and height to match their torso and body dimensions. 
 
3. Perspective Transformation: 
The garment image is transformed using a perspective warp, allowing it to adjust to the 
user’s pose and movement. This feature ensures that the clothing item appears natural and 
properly aligned with the user's body, even when they move or change positions. 

4. Transparency Handling: 
The clothing images used in the system are PNG files with transparent backgrounds, 
which ensures that only the garment is visible while maintaining a clean and realistic 
overlay on the user's body. 

5. User-Friendly Interface: 
The application is designed for simplicity and ease of use, requiring minimal user input. 
It operates via a webcam, with the application automatically detecting and adjusting the 
garment to fit the user’s body in real time.
